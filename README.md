#### What does it mean?

- [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/modules/search.html)

#### Requirements:

- Function that receives a Text Field selector and dropdown item template as its arguments and add make that text field searchable:

- 50,000 names have been provide in a file named: [names.txt](https://github.com/web-advanced-fall-2016/assignment-1-spec/raw/master/names.txt). The search function should search for names inside this file. Each name is provided with the following format: `first-name last-name:rand`. Names are separated with `;`. Copy the names from the file and put it at the end of your JS file statically:

- Search box should be dynamic, meaning, it should update as user changes the input.

- All in plain JavaScript, no JS libraries ( jQuery, ... )


#### Bonus Requirements

* Make it Object Oriented

* Use ES2015.

* Use rank number to order your matches when displaying for user.

* Make the item template more complex, like add a thumbnail image for each items. Doesn't matter what that image is(use just a placeholder). Or show their rank next to their name.
