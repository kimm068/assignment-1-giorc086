# First Assignment: Search Field Element with Dropdown Suggestions 

* [**A Search Field Element With Dropdown for Suggestions From Static Data**](https://github.com/web-advanced-fall-2016/assignment-1-spec/blob/master/README-SEARCH-SUGGESTION-DROPDOWN.md)

## Bonus Requirements
Make it Object Oriented
Use ES2015.
Use rank number to order your matches when displaying for user.
Make the item template more complex, like add a thumbnail image for each items. Doesn't matter what that image is(use just a placeholder). Or show their rank next to their name.

## Submission Details
All the submission must be done through github to our class organization [@web-advanced-fall-2016](https://github.com/web-advanced-fall-2016). The assignment will be accomodated and distributed using [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/). GitHub classroom will automatically create a repository in our organization for each student and will grant administrative rights of that repository to that student.    
All students **MUST** visit this url: [Confirmation Link](https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/2016637b1c5f5a01c2ef6f041bba4bb5). There you will be asked to accept and confirm the reception of the First Assignment and consequently a repository will be automatically created for you under our oranization. The name of your repository will follow the following pattern: `assignment-1-${your GitHub username}`.

Your new repository will start looking exactly like the current repository`assignment-1-spec`. So there will be four versions of README.md under the names of: `README-SLIDER.md`, `README-ACCORDION.md`, `README-MODAL.md`, `README-SEARCH-SUGGESTION-DROPDOWN.md`. Exactly like here now!    
In your own new assignment respository `https://github.com/web-advanced-fall-2016/assignment-1-${your username}`, go on and delete README.md and replace it with the readme of your choice.
